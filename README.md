# Learning-Calculus-with-Python


Python with easy to read and learn features is an wonderful learning aid. It sets up perfect tool to know about calculus and its real-world applications. This workshop goes through the use of calculus in three simulation examples and aims to give a basic introduction and learning pathways for numerical modeling.  The first example is about Brownian motion, second on trajectory models and third on simulation using Pyclaw library. We will have introductory exercise on basic of calculus, different concepts involved in the cases. 

**Workshop outline**
1. Python Basics
2. Calculus basics with Python
     - Sympy introduction 
     - Pyclaw introduction
3. Applications


**Prerequisites**

Python 3 with Numpy, Scipy, SymPy and Matplotlib is prerequisite for examples 1 and 2, Pyclaw is required for example3
